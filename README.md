# AR Foundation & Extensions Template

Reusable Template setup using 
- [AR Foundation 6.0](https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.xr.arfoundation@6.0/manual/index.html), 
- [AR Foundation 6.0 Samples](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/arfoundation-samples) (see [readme](README.Arf.md)),
- [Google Extensions](https://github.com/graphific/arcore-unity-extensions) for geospatial support (localization against streetscape geometries, visualizing street geometries, and scene semantics),
- Scene Semantics (segmentation) adapted [demo-megagolf](https://github.com/google-ar/demo-megagolf)
- modded to support [AR Foundation Replay](https://github.com/asus4/ARFoundationReplay) for basic AR and geospatial functionality
